            Design and Development of a System Application for Rural Student's
            Education
          </li>
          <p>
            I developed a Flutter-based student learning app designed to provide
            comprehensive solutions for all study needs on a single device. The
            app aims to assist rural students by offering study materials and
            interactive learning tools, ensuring that resources are accessible to
            those who need them the most. The project was sponsored by KSCST, and
            I implemented an all-in-one solution to streamline students' access to
            learning materials. The app was built using Flutter, Dart, and
            Firebase technologies, ensuring a seamless and efficient user
            experience.

          <li>Ecommerce Website</li>
          <p>
            I developed an eCommerce website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designing a user-friendly platform that includes features like product listings and a shopping cart. To ensure a seamless experience across all devices, I implemented a responsive design, making the site fully compatible with various screen sizes. The website was deployed on Netlify for optimal performance and accessibility. The project showcases my ability to build intuitive and responsive eCommerce platforms using modern web technologies.

          <li>Non-Invasive Glucometer</li>
          <p>
              I enhanced a glucose measuring device that utilizes IR spectroscopy to non-invasively measure blood glucose levels without the need for blood draws. The device was built using IR spectroscopy to detect glucose levels, and I integrated an Arduino to process the signals and display the glucose readings. The system provides a level of accuracy up to 60%, making it a valuable tool for monitoring glucose without traditional invasive methods. The project involved working with Arduino, IR spectroscopy, and various sensors to deliver a functional and innovative solution.

          <li>Billing System</li>
          <p>
            The Billing System is a C++ application designed to manage retail store operations, including product inventory and customer billing. It enables users to add, update, and view products, as well as generate bills with automatic tax calculations. This project demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, including the creation of classes, and incorporates file handling to store and retrieve data. By utilizing C++ programming and OOP principles, the system provides an efficient and organized solution for retail management.

          <li>Weather App</li>
          <p>
            I developed a Weather App using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and an API to provide real-time weather information. The app allows users to enter a location and view current weather details, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions. I integrated an API to fetch live data, ensuring the app delivers accurate, up-to-date weather information. The design is responsive, ensuring compatibility across various devices, and the app offers an intuitive, user-friendly interface for easy navigation. This project showcases my ability to work with APIs and build interactive web applications.

          <li>Smart Parking</li>
          <p>
            The Smart Parking System utilizes a NodeMCU microcontroller and ultrasonic sensors to detect available parking spaces in real-time. The ultrasonic sensors are strategically placed in parking spots to measure distance and determine whether a space is occupied or vacant. The NodeMCU processes this data and communicates it to a central system or app, providing users with real-time information about available parking spaces. This system enhances parking efficiency by guiding drivers to open spots, reducing search time and congestion. The project demonstrates my expertise in IoT, sensor integration, and real-time data processing using NodeMCU, Lcd Display and Ultrasonic sensors.
